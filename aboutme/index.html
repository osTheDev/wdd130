    <h2>Slade Orme</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Slade and I am a computer science major. This is only my second semester down here but I've
         had a great time so far.</p>
    <p>I currently work full-time doing IT for an electric coop and they are sending me to school! I'm not sure if I want to go
         for a BS but I'm sure I'll figure it out along the way.</p>
    <p>I grew up in the Rexburg area and I love to be outside. I love to ski in the winters and skateboard in the summers. I'm
         also a big sneakerhead and I collect shoes.</p>
    <p></p>
