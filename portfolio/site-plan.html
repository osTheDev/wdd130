      <p>
        Overview
        People will come to my site to see my personal projects/accomplishments to see what I can do and a few of my projects as an example. Visitors will expect to see a front page that is clear and easy to understand. This homepage will work as a landing zone and provide links to my two subpages with my individual projects. Right off the bat, theyll want to know who I am and what the Sites purpose it. Ill achieve this with a short introduction underneath my header that explains my sites purpose and who I am. I plan on having two images with a brief explanation under them that act as clickable buttons to reach my subpages. These images will be Google and Amazon buildings with big signs that will bring the visitor in because they are well recognizable.

        Methods
        Visitors will visit my site instead of another because it will be well put together and professional. My color scheme will change soon because Ive changed my vision for this site. I will use a clean font face and design that will focus attention on my main content. My site will be straight-forward and to the point.

      </ul>
      <h3>AWS</h3>
      <p>
        AWS
        AWS is Amazons cloud computing solution. Using AWS, you can run applications and webpages on cloud servers, host your files securely on the cloud, and build managed databases. AWS offers an integrated development environment for developers, and plenty of
        other tools to help you build, test, and publish your code.

        Project
        Using AWS, I created a website within Cloud9, and deployed it into a bucket within Amazon S3. This consisted of creating an Amazon AWS EC2 instance, setting up my live server, setting up my S3 bucket, and then setting my access policies. After the setup, I developed my webpage using cloud9, and dropped my files into the bucket.

      </ul>
      <h3>Firebase</h3>
      <p>
        Firebase
        Firebase is Google web and mobile app development platform that you can use to deploy sites and web apps. Firebase offers cloud services and tools to help developers build and deploy projects without needing to worry about having their own infrastructure.
        Using Firebase, I deployed a website within Firebase using Firestore and authentication in order to gain access.
        
        Project
        Firebase makes it very easy to create webpages and webpages using their built in tools. They offer integration with existing Google services, which is how I was able to set up Google authentication. After creating my project and setting up my Firebase project, I used Visual Studio Code to create and deploy my code to Firebase.
