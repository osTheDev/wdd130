            <h2>Google's Firebase</h2>

            <p>Firebase is Google's web and mobile app development platform that you can use to deploy sites and web apps. Firebase offers cloud services and tools to help developers build and deploy projects without needing to worry about having their own infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Firebase, I deployed a website within Firebase using Firestore and authentication in order to gain access. Firebase makes it very easy to create webpages and webpages using their built in tools. They offer integration with existing Google services, which is how I was able to set up Google authentication. After creating my project and setting up my Firebase project, I used Visual Studio Code to create and deploy my code to Firebase.
